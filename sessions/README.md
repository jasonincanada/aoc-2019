## Advent of Code 2019

These are recordings of some of my AoC problem-solving sessions.  They are not
particularly interesting but they show my workflow in GHCi and on the command line.  I
usually have multiple screens running and do the actual file editing on another screen
that isn't recorded, so the viewer is spared the tedium of me updating the actual code
itself.  But I try to do everything else in the screen window that is logged.

These files contain ANSI codes that show the original colors I saw in my terminal, so they
are meant to be viewed in the linux shell with the `less -r` command.

For some helpful macros to use while working in `screen`, I have some macros to use with
AutoHotKey in [another repo](https://github.com/jasonincanada/dot-files/blob/master/screen-vi-ghci.ahk).
